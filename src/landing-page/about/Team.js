          We kick-started operations on the 15th of August, 2010 with the goal
          of breaking all barriers that traders and investors face in India in
          terms of cost, support, and technology. We named the company Zerodha,
          a combination of Zero and "Rodha", the Sanskrit word for barrier.
          Today, our disruptive pricing models and in-house technology have made
          us the biggest stock broker in India. Over 1.6+ crore clients place
          billions of orders every year through our powerful ecosystem of
          investment platforms, contributing over 15% of all Indian retail
          trading volumes.
